I have been a part of *the Belt and Road Studnet Summer Camp*.

In the summer camp, the culture of various nations was exchanged in depth. 

We were divided into groups to develop an auto-driving system.

we were trying to develop a system to help the vehicle drive by itself.

International communication was an emphasis in the summer camp.
