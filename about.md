## About me

**I am currently looking for a 12-month joint Ph.D. student position in 2024 fall. My research was funded by *China Scholarship Council (CSC)***



I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the [school of information and electronics](https://sie.bit.edu.cn/) at the Beijing Institute of Technology, under the supervision of [Prof.Shafei Wang](https://ysg.ckcest.cn/html/details/8031/index.html). I received my bachelor's degree in the faculty of information technology at Beijing University of Technology. My research interests are focused on statistical signal processing, sequential change point detection and time-series analysis.
